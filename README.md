# PyPredict

PyPredict is a simple Python script that predicts the time of the next event based on past event times using linear regression. The script accepts input times in the `hh:mm` format in the 24-hour time format.

## Installation

To run PyPredict, you will need to install scikit-learn. You can install scikit-learn using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

If you're using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it before installing the package.

## Usage
Run the script from the command line with the past event times as arguments:

```bash
python predict_next_event.py 01:30 03:00 04:30 06:00
```

The script will output the predicted time of the next event in the hh:mm format.

Please note that the linear regression model used in this example is quite simple and may not accurately predict more complex event patterns. You can improve the model by using more advanced machine learning techniques, incorporating more features, or using a time series prediction model like ARIMA, depending on the nature of your data.
